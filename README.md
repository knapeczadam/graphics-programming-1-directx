# 🪟 Graphics Programming 1 – DirectX  

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or graphics tinkerer 👋  
Welcome to my **Graphics Programming 1 – DirectX** repository — part of the **third semester (2023)** at **Digital Arts & Entertainment**, **Howest University**, **Kortrijk, Belgium**.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains the **third and final project** of the Graphics Programming 1 course — a **GPU-based real-time renderer** built using **DirectX 11**.  
It builds on the knowledge gained from the **raytracer** and **software rasterizer** projects, moving fully into the GPU domain with hardware-accelerated rendering and physically-based shading.

> ⚠️ Note: this project was created for educational purposes.  
> Expect experimental code, occasional inefficiencies, and strong focus on understanding how DirectX 11 manages rendering pipelines.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project marks the completion of the **Graphics Programming 1** series — moving from theoretical raytracing to practical, GPU-based real-time rendering.  
It was a major step toward understanding modern rendering pipelines, shaders, and performance considerations in game technology.

If you’re diving into DirectX yourself: **experiment, profile, and learn how the GPU truly works** 🔬⚙️
