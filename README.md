# ⚙️ Graphics Programming 1 – DirectX (2023)

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or graphics tinkerer 👋  
Welcome to my **Graphics Programming 1 – DirectX** repository — part of the **third semester (2023)** at **Digital Arts & Entertainment**, **Howest University**, **Kortrijk, Belgium**.

---

## 🗂️ About this repository

This repo contains the **third and final project** of the Graphics Programming 1 course — a **GPU-based real-time renderer** built using **DirectX 11**.  
It builds on the knowledge gained from the **raytracer** and **software rasterizer** projects, moving fully into the GPU domain with hardware-accelerated rendering and physically-based shading.

> ⚠️ Note: this project was created for educational purposes.  
> Expect experimental code, occasional inefficiencies, and strong focus on understanding how DirectX 11 manages rendering pipelines.

## 🎯 Learning Goals (LR07 + LR09)

> *The student develops interactive 3D applications using game technology in an efficient, technically proficient way.*  
> *The student writes maintainable, optimized C++ code and integrates rendering algorithms based on performance constraints.*

- Implements a **3D application** using the **DirectX 11 graphics API**.  
- Utilizes **GPU rendering** for real-time image generation.  
- Applies **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** principles.  
- Writes efficient and maintainable **C++ graphics code**.  
- Manages shaders, buffers, and textures in a modern GPU pipeline.

## 🔖 Repository Structure

All code and assets for the DirectX project are located on the **main branch**.  
It demonstrates the transition from CPU-based to GPU-accelerated rendering, using DirectX 11 for efficient, real-time 3D visualization.

## 🚀 Releases

Builds are available in the [📦 Releases](../../releases) section.  
Example:

`graphics_programming_1-directx-03-1.0.0-windows-x64.zip`

Includes the full DirectX 11 GPU renderer built for Windows x64.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project marks the completion of the **Graphics Programming 1** series — moving from theoretical raytracing to practical, GPU-based real-time rendering.  
It was a major step toward understanding modern rendering pipelines, shaders, and performance considerations in game technology.

If you’re diving into DirectX yourself: **experiment, profile, and learn how the GPU truly works** 🔬⚙️
